This is Harvard public course CS50 after-class solutions.
I'm very new to programming and my code looks silly that I know XD.

Postponed updating for a while as I am currently running out of time.
I've finished studying all the lectures today but won't be spending time solving 
pset-problems by now. 
I need to learn "job-orient" skills first so I'll jump into some web-programming courses
and put this one behind.
Will try to solve remained problems without pre-written code later this year if I got time.
Hope I can get a job as soon as possible.
